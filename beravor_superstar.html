My themed progression Deck for Mirkwood Cycle

The theme here is this: [Beravor](/card/01012) is a charismatic rockstar, and singing is her main skill. She rides down the Anduin with her band, trying to be  stealthy. [Song of Wisdom](/card/02034) is her favorite tune, but every now and then she loves to play [Song of Kings](/card/02010) for her aficionados. 

This deck is based on keeping threat as low as possible, while buffing [Beravor](/card/01012) as a defender and [DÃºnhere](/card/01009) as an attacker. The longer it can attack on staging area, the better. 

Music is the main theme, so [Rivendell Minstrel](/card/02008) is somehow seen as a wondeful session player. [Gandalf](/card/01073) is the tour manager, aka the guy how saves the day every now and then.


I will keep this updated...
